Divide the class into two teams (with students of mixed abilities in each team). One team plays at a time. When you start the timer, students in one team take turns to run to the board, say a word and tap the picture. When all the pictures have been tapped, record the time, then invite the next team to play. When the second team has finished, compare times. Play again.\nTIP: To make sure students SAY the words, make a rule that if students do not say each word before tapping it, the other team automatically wins.",
